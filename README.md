# my_first_github_project
This is my first ever github repository.

In this repository, a number of test files are created to learn about git.

## TODOs
1. Learn git terminology.
2. Learn to navigate the github interface.
3. Learn git in the command line.

Adding some new lines for testing purposes to the readme file.
